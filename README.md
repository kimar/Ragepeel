***Ragepeel***

Ragepeel is your Ragefaces viewer attached to the ragefac.es REST-API, which has been abandoned :-(
Due to this fact I have removed the App from the AppStore and made it OpenSource, maybe some one may fork and connect it to another API. For further info have a look at [http://indiecoder.net](http://indiecoder.net)
